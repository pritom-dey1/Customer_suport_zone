## üìå Technical Details

- **React**: Functional components with hooks.
- **State Management**: `useState` hook for managing ticket statuses, progress, and resolved tasks.
- **Props**: Passed data to child components for display and interaction.
- **Event Handling**: Clicking tickets or buttons triggers state updates and toast notifications.
- **React-Toastify**: Stylish toast notifications replace default alerts.

## üìù Key Concepts

### JSX
JSX (JavaScript XML) allows you to write HTML-like syntax in React components. It is used for rendering UI elements in a more readable way.

### State vs Props
- **State**: Mutable data local to a component that can change over time.  
- **Props**: Immutable data passed from parent to child components.

### useState Hook
- `useState` is a React hook used to manage state in functional components.  
- Returns an array: `[state, setState]`.  
### Sharing State Between Components

- Lift the state up to a common parent and pass it down as props to child components.
### Event Handling

- Events in React are handled using camelCase syntax and passing functions as callbacks
### üîî Challenge Requirements Implemented

- React-Toastify used for all alerts.

- Task Completion Logic:

- Clicking Complete Button removes the ticket from Task Status.

- Adds it to Resolved List.

- Decreases In Progress count and increases Resolved count.

- Removes ticket from Customer Tickets list.
